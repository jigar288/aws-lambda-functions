      * Refractor 
        ! NOTE: not all of this is necessary --> find tasks where you really learn
        - make repeated vars as class fields --> DRY
        - read through fixme statements
        - add modifiers where necessary (final, private, protected)
        - find places for constructor based dependency injection w/o spring

      TODO: 
      - Tasks
      - write test cases for all your code
      - check google docs for tasks outside of MVP
      - make spring routes for api gateway 
      - things to consider for API 
        - performance --> caching, load balancing for more traffic 
        - security --> authorization & authintication 
        - testability --> write unit tests for routes --> helps you discover edge cases

      !EFFICIENCY TACTICS
       - avoid repeatitive patterns --> deploy, test, deploy, test, deploy, test
       - chunk everything --> deploy once & test everything all at once

       * TEST Points:
       * - subscribe & unsubscribe email input
       * - DB read & write
       * - send notification function
       * - test changes from commit messages
       * - test removed error handling for unsub
      
       !commit messages
        - change from static method to non-static --> use snsClient as class object
        - removed unnecessary error handling --> test it
