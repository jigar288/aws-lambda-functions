      * Refractor 
        ! NOTE: not all of this is necessary --> find tasks where you really learn
        - read through fixme statements
        - think of ways to refractor code --> shouldn't have to refractor next time
        - add modifiers where necessary (final, private, protected)
        - find places for dependency injection
        - read through fixme(s)
        - return success/fail for subscribe
        - identify hard-coded areas --> refractor it
        - return item not found --> for getItem.java
        - throw no items found if none exist
